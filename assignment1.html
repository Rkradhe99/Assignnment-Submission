    <h1><u>Nature Beautiful Pictures</u></h1>
    <p>Nature is made of everything we see around us â€“ trees, flowers, plants, animals, sky, mountains, forests and
        more. Human beings depend on nature to stay alive. Nature helps us breathe, gives us food, water, shelter,
        medicines, and clothes. We find many colors in nature which make the Earth beautiful</p>

    <p>A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show significant exposed
        bedrock. A mountain differs from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is larger than a hill, typically
        rising at least 300 metres (1000 feet) above the surrounding land.</p>

    <p>Conservation of nature means the preservation of forests, land, water bodies, and minerals, fuels, natural gases,
        etc. ... Thus all these natural resources make life worth living on Earth. Life would not be imaginable without
        air, water, sunlight as well as other natural resources present on the earth.</p>
